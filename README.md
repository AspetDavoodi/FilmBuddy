# FilmBuddy
This is a small project for helping film photographers choose their next (or first!) roll of film.


Hey!
--------------
Did you decide to shoot film?
--------------
If your answer was yes, then I’m glad you ended up here. If you can’t choose your first roll of film, just download this program, run main.py and you’ll have a few (good) suggestions to make your choice a little bit easier.

Overview:

Who is this project created for?- Beginner film photographers, and those who have a hard time picking their next roll of film.

Why did I create this?- Beginner film photographers usually have a hard time choosing their first roll of film, as the variety is virtually limitless. Seasoned film photographs also struggle with this issue when they want to experiment and try something different than what they usually shoot with.

This program can take the user’s preferences and suggest a number of film rolls from which the user will make the final choice.

When is this project going to be completed? - End of May, 2019 (as many films are in stock during this period)

What is this program?- A python console application to run on PCs.

How is this program created? - The program is built using python, the film database is going to be saved in a complementary json file.

User Problems Solved!

User Need: Administators need to be able to add new film rolls to the database.
Solution: FilmBuddy has a dedicated Admin mode for administrators to be able to update the datablase.

User Need: Users need to be able to provide information about their preferences to which the rolls has to correspond (i.e: budget, shooting preferences)
Solution: Before suggesting anything, FilmBuddy's user mode takes the preferences of the user to fine tune the suggestions.
