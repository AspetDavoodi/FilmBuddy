# FilmBuddy
This is a small project for helping film photographers choose their next (or first!) roll of film.


Hey!
--------------
Did you decide to shoot film?
-------------
If your answer was yes, then I’m glad you ended up here. If you can’t choose your first roll of film, just download this program, run it (follow the steps in the instructions.txt file :D) and you’ll have a few (good) suggestions to make your choice a little bit easier.
---------------------------------------------


Who is this project created for?- Beginner film photographers, and those who have a hard time picking their next roll of film.

Why did I create this?- Beginner film photographers usually have a hard time choosing their first roll of film, as the variety is virtually limitless. There are many variables that affect the resulting photos, which can be quite intimidating when you’re just starting out. 
Seasoned film photographs also struggle with this issue when they want to experiment and try something different than what they usually shoot with.
This program can take the user’s preferences and suggest a number of film rolls from which the user will make the final choice.

When is this project going to be completed? - Start of Summer of 2019 (as many films are in stock during this period)

What is the nature of this program?- A python program including a graphical user interface.

How is this program created? - The program is going to be built using python, the film database is going to be saved in a complementary text file (.txt)
